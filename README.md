# 3HourBlog
very basic blog made within 3 hours with nodejs , express , mysql..
I didn't upload node_modules .. so remember to install the modules 
by inputting "npm i" in cmd/terminal.. also dont forget to import 
the sql file .

Done as a 5 hour Lab-Task of the course Advanced Topics in Programming-3 (check Lab_Task_ATP_3.docx)..
the project had to be done using laravel .. But being a NODE guy and not knowing anything of laravel or
even PHP I had to go with NODE

N.B. no CSS added
